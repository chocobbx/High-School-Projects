But the reason  why this is also my dad's talent is because he used his gift to make it   his talent. This is called a super talent. This makes me so proud. I am so  comfortable bragging about my dad, even though it is sin. :)</td> </tr> <tr>  <td class="jo"><img class="jk" src="mom.jpg"><br>Bae Seoung Yun (Mother)</td>  <td>My mother's talent is to cook and bake foods. She is such a talented  cooker and baker because she makes the food so appetizing and delectable.  She has fed 5 human being for about 20 years everyday! Let me state a fact,  it is not easy to feed 5 human beings for about 20 years everyday! Therefore,  I am really grateful that I have this food talented person as my mom.</td> </tr> <tr>  <td class="jo"><img class="jk" src="sis.jpg"><br>Esther Cho (Sister)</td>  <td>"I can call myself a musician and a producer. I can play different kinds   of musical instruments including piano, violin and flute. I enjoy singing and   I direct small performances in the church and at work such as performing   dramas and choreographing dances and stage performances.<br></br>- I have the talent of teaching which is also my job and calling. <br>- a creative thinker and a good storyteller? hahaha" </td> </tr> <tr>  <td class="jo"><img class="jk" src="bro.jpg"><br>Moses Cho (Brother)</td>  <td>"I have been playing drums for about fourteen years. I currently play   drums for the main service at my church and lead worship for the high school   group on Sunday nights. I also have been working with children, specifically   children between the ages two and six. My passion for young children gave me   a sense of direction for me to pursue this career field. Lastly, I have   learned to fix and maintain cars. Since I have owned a car, basic maintenance   such as engine oil change, brake change, and repairing minor mechanical   malfunction has became a hobby to me."</td> </tr> <tr>  <td class="jo"><img class="jk" src="me.jpg"><br>Timothy Cho (Me)</td>  <td>"What is my talent? One of my talent is to make people. I have contagious   laughter. For instance if someone sees me laugh, they laugh too. I really  believe this is the gift from God. My other talent is an encourager. I   am a person who is positive and can encourage others to be positive too. Many   of my friends feel grateful to me because I either made their day by making   them laugh or I rescued them from negative to positive. :)"</td> </tr></table></div></body></html>
